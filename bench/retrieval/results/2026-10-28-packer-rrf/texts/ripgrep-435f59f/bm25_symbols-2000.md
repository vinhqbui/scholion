    /// In all other cases, this has no effect.

    /// The directory may be descended into. The matcher includes the ignore
    /// rules loaded through this directory and is therefore the matcher to use
    /// for its children.
    Allowed(Ignore),
    /// The directory may not be descended into because it was ignored by a

```
- Hidden.doc_long (crates/core/flags/defs.rs:2868-2885)
```rust
    fn doc_long(&self) -> &'static str {
        r#"
Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories
are skipped. Note that if a hidden file or a directory is whitelisted in
an ignore file, then it will be searched even if this flag isn't provided.
Similarly if a hidden file or directory is given explicitly as an argument to
ripgrep.
.sp
A file or directory is considered hidden if its base name starts with a dot
character (\fB.\fP). On operating systems which support a "hidden" file
attribute, like Windows, files with this attribute are also considered hidden.
.sp
Note that \flag{hidden} will include files and folders like \fB.git\fP
regardless of \flag{no-ignore-vcs}. To exclude such paths when using
\flag{hidden}, you must explicitly ignore them using another flag or ignore
file.

- Sort.doc_long (crates/core/flags/defs.rs:6694-6728)
```rust
    fn doc_long(&self) -> &'static str {
        r"
This flag enables sorting of results in ascending order. The possible values
for this flag are:
.sp
.TP 12
\fBnone\fP
(Default) Do not sort results. Fastest. Can be multi-threaded.
.TP 12
\fBpath\fP
Sort by file path. Always single-threaded. The order is determined by sorting
files in each directory entry during traversal. This means that given the files
\fBa/b\fP and \fBa+\fP, the latter will sort after the former even though
\fB+\fP would normally sort before \fB/\fP.
.TP 12
\fBmodified\fP
Sort by the last modified time on a file. Always single-threaded.
.TP 12
\fBaccessed\fP
Sort by the last accessed time on a file. Always single-threaded.
.TP 12
\fBcreated\fP
Sort by the creation time on a file. Always single-threaded.
.PP
If the chosen (manually or by-default) sorting criteria isn't available on your
system (for example, creation time is not available on ext4 file systems), then
ripgrep will attempt to detect this, print an error and exit without searching.
.sp
To sort results in reverse or descending order, use the \flag{sortr} flag.
Also, this flag overrides \flag{sortr}.
.sp
Note that sorting results currently always forces ripgrep to abandon
parallelism and run in a single thread.
