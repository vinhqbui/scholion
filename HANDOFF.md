# Handoff: 2026-11-03

Delete this once you've acted on the open items. It links; the detail lives in the files named.

## 1. Merged

All on `main`; per-feature detail is in `CHANGELOG.md` (the `Unreleased` section, `0.0.3` and `0.0.2`).

- **Plan 7**, overlay index scopes: `bench/results/2026-10-30-e2-overlay/`.
- **Plan 8**, routing (backlog, agent profiles, `av next`) and **Plan 9**, the review loop (`next`
  offers reviews and merges first; `av watch`): `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-31-scholion-plan-8-routing.md`,
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-31-scholion-plan-9-review-loop.md`.
- **Plan 10 A1-A4** (the Community side of the editions plan: ordering with `after`, `max_open`,
  targets, office and timelines, `checkpoint` events, `margincode-agentrun`, the redesigned
  dashboard): `CHANGELOG.md`. The plan itself is in the agentvcs repo
  (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-31-agentvcs-plan-10-editions-mvp.md`).
- **Plan 11**, lean disk (workspaces reclaimed, one cargo cache per repo, `av disk`/`av gc`, the
  session footprint): `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-02-scholion-plan-11-lean-disk.md`. Its
  shared per-repo target dir was unsafe and is replaced by Plan 12.
- **Plan 12** so far (#71–#83): one `target/` per task workspace with a lean profile (about 20 GB
  per Rust task down to 1.2 GB while open, 0 B once merged), build output removed at merge,
  dependencies built once per repo, one test binary per crate, `next --wait` woken by events,
  and per-host caps `av watch --max-agents` / `av validate --max-builds` (`margincode-agentrun::slots`).
- **Release 0.0.2** (tag `release/0.0.2`), the first to ship `margincode-daemon` with bundled Postgres.
- **Release 0.0.3** (tag `release/0.0.3`, 2026-11-06): proposals, `av attention`, `av repo advance`, `av notes`, cold start
  from git history, `embeddinggemma-2` as the default embedder, one approval per head and the redesigned dashboard.

## 2. Open

Each item names what it waits on.

1. **Plan 12, lean builds** (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-03-scholion-plan-12-lean-builds.md`).
   Tasks 1, 2 (`{crates}` in a check, #84), 3 (a task's builds in its own `target/`, #85), 5 and 6
   are merged. Task 4 was measured (#87): the test run, not the build, is the long pole, so
   workspace slots are deferred until a measurement says otherwise.
2. **Plan 6 evaluation**: E4-at-scale (the DeepSeek relay run, the product claim) and E5-E7
   (swarm against a git baseline, planted-defect review, Plan 5 features under load). They spend
   API money, so they wait on the owner's go.
   `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-25-scholion-plan-6-evaluation.md`; run guide `bench/README.md`.
3. **Plan 8 Grok evaluation**, written, never run. E-G0 (Grok as an `av` agent) was observed on
   2026-10-31 (`bench/results/2026-10-31-routing-grok/conformance.md`); the routing runs (G1 and
   later) spend money and wait on the owner's go.
   `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-31-plan-8-grok-evaluation.md`.
4. **Name fan-out cap**: built, off by default (`AV_INDEX_MAX_FANOUT=N`). E1 at caps 64 and 16
   left pack scores unchanged but for one task at one budget and cut edges 40% / 54%
   (`bench/results/2026-11-03-e1-fanout-cap/`). Waits on the owner's choice of N and of a
   default, and on a rust-lang/rust import under the cap (it stalled at ~4 GB uncapped).
5. **Sparse checkouts**: not planned; only if workspace disk or snapshot time becomes the limiter
   (build output, not checkouts, was 99.99% of a task's disk). **Checkpoint by patch** (remote
   workspaces, Plan 13 Phase 3) is Plan 14, on branch `remote-checkpoint`
   (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-04-scholion-plan-14-remote-workspaces.md`).
6. **Adapter verification against the real CLIs.** `av init --for codex|gemini|cursor` is tested
   against fixtures only (`integrations/*/README.md`); it waits on those CLIs being installed.
   Muse Code's settings path is still unknown (`integrations/muse/README.md`). Grok is verified.
7. **Dashboard agent timeline** (Plan 10 A3 remainder): the owner's decision; the recommendation
   is to keep Community `/ui` read-only with its Teams panel.

## 3. Rules that bite

- Branch off `main`, one PR per change; fmt, clippy `-D warnings` and `cargo test --workspace`
  green first (`CLAUDE.md`).
- A merged migration is never edited; check `main`'s highest number before adding one.
- Code flows margincode to agentvcs, never back.
