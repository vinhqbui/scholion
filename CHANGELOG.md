# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Backlog items can start after others merge**: `av post --after ITEM[,ITEM]` (an item id or the
  slug of its title; `after` in `POST /v1/backlog`). `av next` does not offer the item, and
  `start_task` without a title does not take it, until every listed item has merged; `av backlog`
  shows it as `waiting on X`. Migration 0026.
- **`next` gives a conflicted task back to its owner**: after reviews, an approved task whose merge
  conflicted comes back to its owner (`"from": "conflicted"`, with a `next` action: `av sync` onto
  main, resolve the markers, re-run the check, validate and submit again), so `av watch` picks it
  up. If the owner does not act within the lease, any agent that fits may claim it; it stays
  conflicted.

## 0.0.2 (2026-11-01)

Several coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, Gemini CLI) now share one backlog:
each takes the work that fits it, reviews the others' work, and merges what it approves.

### Install and run

- **The release now includes `scholion-daemon`, with its own Postgres (lite mode).** `av init`
  in a git repository starts it and adds the repo; no Docker needed. 0.0.1 shipped only the CLI,
  so the installer in the README failed on it.
- `av init --for codex|grok|gemini|cursor` wires those CLIs to the MCP server. Grok, Gemini and
  Cursor also get an `X-Av-Agent` header, so the daemon knows which agent is calling.

### Route work to the agent that fits (Plan 8)

- **Agent profiles**: `av agent set NAME --best TAGS --can TAGS --cost N`. 1 is the cheapest.
- **A backlog**: `av post --repo R --title T --goal G [--needs TAGS] [--prefer NAME]`, then
  `av backlog`. Tags are set by people; the routing rules are deterministic, with no LLM call.
- **`av next`, or `start_task` with no title and goal**, gives an agent the next task that fits
  it. A task is reserved for its best agent for 10 minutes, then any agent that can do it may
  take it.
- `av handoff --needs TAGS` hands a task to an agent with those skills.

### Close the review loop (Plan 9)

- `next` offers, in order: reviews of other agents' work, handoffs, abandoned tasks, then new
  work. An owner never reviews its own task. The reviewer merges what it approves.
- `av next --wait N` (MCP: `wait`) waits up to 50 s for work instead of returning empty.
- `av watch -- CMD` starts an agent CLI only when there is work for it. It runs on your machine;
  the daemon never starts processes.
- **A team's limit**: `av agent set NAME ... --max-open N`. At the limit, an agent is offered only
  reviews and its own unfinished tasks until it submits or hands one off.
- MCP tools take a task's slug (or `repo/slug`) as well as its id. The CLI still takes the id.
- One MCP session can hold several tasks: Claude Code's subagents share their parent's
  session. Without `task_id`, a call uses the session's only open task, or asks which one.
  Before, a subagent's `start_task` sent the parent's later calls to the wrong task without an
  error.

### Packs, index and scale

- Work packs are 800 tokens of signatures by default. Lexical (BM25) and semantic hits are
  combined by rank fusion.
- Overlay index (Plan 7): a task reads main's index plus its own changes and no longer copies the
  index at start. A start that waits for its turn creates nothing until it gets one.
- Hooks show other tasks' records when an agent opens a file.

### For code built on the daemon

- Extension points in `scholion_daemon`: `router_with`, `with_extension`, `subscribe_events`,
  `MergeGuard`, and `AppState::migrate_extension`. An extension runs its own migrations in its
  own Postgres schema, so its migration numbers never clash with the daemon's.

### Upgrading from 0.0.1

- Stop the daemon and install the new binaries (rerun the installer, or `git pull` and
  `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --build`). The daemon adds its new tables
  (migrations 0021-0024) at start-up; existing tasks and records stay as they were.
- Restart your agent CLIs so they load the new tool parameters.

### Evidence

- A real run: two Claude Code agents on DeepSeek Flash took tasks from the backlog, reviewed each
  other's work and merged it. Reproduce it with `examples/routing-smoke/deepseek-demo.sh`; that
  run cost about $0.03. It shows that the loop works. It is not a measurement of token savings.
- Benchmarks and their limits: `bench/results/`. Plain notes files delivered recorded lessons as
  well as av did at 10 notes (E4). The task set with 300 notes (`bench/tasks-relay-scale`) is
  ready but has not been run, so av's advantage at scale is not measured yet.

## 0.0.1 (2026-10-28)

First release: the `scholion` CLI (alias `av`). The daemon ran from Docker
(`deploy/docker-compose.yml`).
